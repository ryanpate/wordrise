## 🚀 Next Steps: Building the Flask Web App

### Phase 1: Flask API (Week 1-2)
Create REST API endpoints:
```
POST   /api/game/start          # Start new game
POST   /api/game/add-word       # Add word to tower
POST   /api/game/hint           # Get hint
POST   /api/game/undo           # Undo last word
GET    /api/game/state          # Get game state
POST   /api/game/end            # End game and get score
GET    /api/daily-word          # Get daily challenge word
```

### Phase 2: Database Integration (Week 2-3)
Setup PostgreSQL with:
- User accounts
- Game history
- Daily challenge participation
- Leaderboards
- User statistics

### Phase 3: Frontend (Week 3-4)
Create responsive web interface:
- Landing page
- Game interface
- Leaderboards page
