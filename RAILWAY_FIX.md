# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue
Railway deployment failed with: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'`

## ✅ Solution (FIXED!)

The issue was that PostgreSQL driver was missing from dependencies. 

**I've updated the requirements.txt file to include:**
```
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
```

## 🚀 How to Deploy Now

### Option 1: Re-download and Deploy
1. **[Download the fixed version](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/wordrise-enhanced.zip)**
2. Push to your GitHub repository
3. Railway will auto-deploy with the fix

### Option 2: Quick Fix on Existing Deployment

If you already pushed to GitHub, just update `requirements.txt`:

1. **Edit `requirements.txt` in your repo**
2. **Add this line at the end:**
   ```
   psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
   ```
3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Add PostgreSQL driver"
   git push
   ```
4. **Railway will auto-redeploy** ✅

### Option 3: Update via Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings" → "Build Command"
4. Add before the existing command:
   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2-binary==2.9.9 && python setup_words.py && gunicorn run:app
   ```

## 📝 Updated requirements.txt

Your `requirements.txt` should now contain:

```txt
Flask==3.0.0
Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.1.1
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
Flask-Migrate==4.0.5
PyJWT==2.8.0
requests==2.31.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
nltk==3.8.1
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9  ← THIS WAS MISSING
```

## ✨ After Fix

Once deployed successfully, you should see:
```
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080
[INFO] Booting worker with pid: X
```

No errors! 🎉

## 🧪 Verify Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Visit your Railway URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. **Check health endpoint:** `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
   
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "wordrise-enhanced"
   }
   ```

3. **Try to register** a new account
4. **Start a game** and play!

## 🐛 If Still Having Issues

### Check Railway Logs

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Deployments"
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. View the logs

### Common Additional Issues

#### Word Database Not Setup
**Error:** "Word not found" or similar
**Fix:** 
- The `railway.json` should handle this automatically
- If not, connect to Railway shell and run:
  ```bash
  railway run bash
  python setup_words.py
  exit
  ```

#### Database Not Initialized
**Error:** Table doesn't exist errors
**Fix:**
- Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway if not already added
- Database tables are created automatically in `run.py`
- Check that DATABASE_URL is set (Railway sets this automatically)

#### Secret Key Warning
**Warning:** Using default secret key
**Fix:**
- Add `SECRET_KEY` environment variable in Railway
- Generate with: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`

## 📞 Need More Help?

If you're still stuck:
1. Check the full error message in Railway logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure PostgreSQL plugin is added
4. Try a fresh deployment
