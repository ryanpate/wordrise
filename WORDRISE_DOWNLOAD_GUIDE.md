## 🎮 What is WordRise?

**WordRise** is an addictive word-building game where players:
1. Start with a 3-letter word (like "ART")
2. Add ONE letter to build a new word (like "TART")
3. Use ALL letters from the previous word
4. Keep building to create the tallest tower!

### Example Tower:
```
STREAM  (6 letters) +M → Level 4 → 24 points
START   (5 letters) +S → Level 3 → 15 points
TART    (4 letters) +T → Level 2 → 8 points
ART     (3 letters)    → Level 1 → 3 points
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                         Total: 50 points
```

## 📊 Game Statistics

```
📝 1,425 lines of Python code
📚 3,154 words in database
✅ 27 unit tests (all passing)
⚡ O(1) word lookup speed
🎮 Production-ready
```

---

## 🎯 Game Rules

### How to Build Your Tower:
1. ✅ Start with a 3-letter word
2. ✅ Add EXACTLY ONE new letter
3. ✅ Use ALL letters from the word below
4. ✅ Rearrange letters in any order
5. ✅ No duplicate words

### Valid Moves:
- ART → **TART** ✅ (add T)
- TART → **START** ✅ (add S)
- CAT → **TACK** ✅ (add K, rearrange)

### Invalid Moves:
- ART → PATH ❌ (missing R)
- CAT → TABLE ❌ (too many new letters)
- ART → ART ❌ (duplicate)

---

## 📈 Scoring System

### Base Score
```
word_length × level_number

Example:
Level 1: ART (3 letters) = 3 × 1 = 3 points
Level 2: TART (4 letters) = 4 × 2 = 8 points
Level 3: START (5 letters) = 5 × 3 = 15 points
Total Base Score: 26 points
```

### Bonuses
- **Uncommon Letters** (Q, Z, X, J, K): +5 points each
- **Speed Bonus**: +10% if completed under 5 minutes

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (any recent Python 3 version)
- **No external dependencies** (uses standard library only)
- **Cross-platform** (Windows, Mac, Linux)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: Build the Web App!

The game engine is complete. Now build:

### Phase 1: Flask API (1-2 weeks)
```python
POST /api/game/start       # Start new game
POST /api/game/add-word    # Add word
GET  /api/game/state       # Get state
POST /api/game/end         # Get score
```

### Phase 2: Frontend (2 weeks)
- Responsive game interface
- Mobile-friendly design
- Real-time score updates
- Leaderboards

### Phase 3: Deploy (1 week)
- Railway or Heroku
- PostgreSQL database
- Domain: **wordrise.app**
- SSL + CDN

---

## 🎓 Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic Game
```python
from app.game_engine import WordRiseGame

game = WordRiseGame('cat')
game.add_word('tack')
game.add_word('stack')
game.add_word('stacks')

results = game.end_game()
print(f"Score: {results['total_score']}")
```

### Example 2: Daily Challenge
```python
from app.game_engine import WordRiseGame
from datetime import date

# Get today's word (same for all players!)
daily_word = WordRiseGame.get_daily_word()
game = WordRiseGame(daily_word)

print(f"Today's challenge: {daily_word.upper()}")
```

### Example 3: With Hints
```python
game = WordRiseGame('art')

# Get a hint
hint = game.get_hint('starts_with')
print(hint['hint'])  
# Output: "Try a word starting with 'T'"

game.add_word('tart')
print(f"Hints used: {game.hints_used}")  # 1
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Building Towers
- Start with common 3-letter words (art, cat, bat)
- Look for words with vowels (easier to extend)
- Save uncommon letters (Q, Z, X) for bonus points
- Use hints strategically

### For Developers
- Game engine is framework-agnostic
- Easy to integrate with Flask/Django
- Database-ready design
- RESTful API structure

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't run demo?
