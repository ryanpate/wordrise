# WordRise - Random Mode Update 🎲

## What Changed

Your WordRise game has been updated from **one daily challenge per day** to **unlimited random games**!

### Before ❌
- One starting word per day (same for everyone)
- Had to wait until tomorrow for a new word
- Used date-based seed for consistency

### After ✅  
- Different random 3-letter word every time you start
- Unlimited plays - start as many games as you want!
- Each game is unique

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Game Engine (`game_engine.py`)

**Changed Method:**
```python
# OLD METHOD (removed)
@staticmethod
def get_daily_word(day: Optional[date] = None) -> str:
    # Used date as seed for consistency
    # Same word all day for everyone

# NEW METHOD
@staticmethod
def get_random_starting_word() -> str:
    """
    Get a random 3-letter word for starting a new game
    Returns a different word each time for unlimited replayability
    """
    validator = WordValidator()
    three_letter_words = validator.get_words_of_length(3)
    return random.choice(three_letter_words)
```

**Key Differences:**
- ❌ Removed: Date-based seeding
- ❌ Removed: `day` parameter
- ✅ Added: True randomization each time
- ✅ Added: Unlimited replayability

---

### 2. API Routes (`api_routes.py`)

**Updated Endpoint:**
```python
@api_bp.route('/game/start', methods=['POST'])
def start_game():
    # OLD: starting_word = WordRiseGame.get_daily_word()
    # NEW: starting_word = WordRiseGame.get_random_starting_word()
    
    starting_word = WordRiseGame.get_random_starting_word()
    game = WordRiseGame(starting_word=starting_word)
    
    return jsonify({
        'success': True,
        'starting_word': starting_word,
        'game_state': game.get_game_state()
    })
```

---

### 3. Frontend Changes Needed

**JavaScript - Update Game Start:**

```javascript
// OLD CODE (remove this):
async function startDailyChallenge() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/daily', {
        method: 'GET'
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    startingWord = data.daily_word;
}

// NEW CODE (use this):
async function startNewGame() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/game/start', {
        method: 'POST'
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success) {
        startingWord = data.starting_word;
        tower = [startingWord];
        updateUI();
    }
}
```

**HTML - Update Buttons:**

```html
<!-- OLD: -->
<button id="dailyChallengeBtn">Daily Challenge</button>

<!-- NEW: -->
<button id="newGameBtn" onclick="startNewGame()">
    🎲 New Random Game
</button>
```

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Replace Files

1. **Back up your current files:**
   ```bash
   cp game_engine.py game_engine.py.backup
   ```

2. **Replace with new files:**
   - Copy `game_engine.py` to your project
   - Copy `api_routes.py` to your project (or update existing routes)

3. **Update your frontend:**
   - Change "Daily Challenge" button to "New Game"
   - Update button click to call `startNewGame()`
   - Remove any references to `/api/daily`

4. **Test it:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   Visit your app and click "New Game" multiple times - you should get different starting words!

### Option 2: Quick Git Deployment

If using Railway/Netlify:

```bash
# 1. Replace files in your repo
cp game_engine.py your-wordrise-repo/
cp api_routes.py your-wordrise-repo/

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Random word mode instead of daily challenge"
git push

# 3. Auto-deploys in 2-3 minutes!
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ Click "New Game" - should get a random 3-letter word  
✅ Click "New Game" again - should get a DIFFERENT word  
✅ Start 5 games - should get 5 different starting words  
✅ Game mechanics still work (building tower, validation, scoring)  
✅ Can play multiple games without waiting  

---

## Benefits of This Change

### For Players:
- 🎮 **Unlimited Games** - Play as many times as you want
- 🎲 **Variety** - Every game is different
- ⚡ **Instant Replay** - No waiting for tomorrow
- 🔥 **More Addictive** - "Just one more game!"

### For You:
- 📈 **Higher Engagement** - Players can binge play
- 🚀 **Better Retention** - More reasons to come back
- 💰 **More Ad Views** - More games = more impressions
- 🎯 **Simpler Logic** - No date tracking needed

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to go back to daily challenge mode:

```bash
# Restore backup
cp game_engine.py.backup game_engine.py

# Or revert git commit
git revert HEAD
git push
```

---

## What Stays the Same

✅ Game mechanics (tower building rules)  
✅ Word validation (hybrid local + API)  
✅ Scoring system  
✅ Hints  
✅ All other features  

**Only difference:** Starting word is now random instead of date-based!

---

## Questions?

The change is very simple:
1. One method name changed: `get_daily_word()` → `get_random_starting_word()`
2. Frontend calls `/api/game/start` instead of `/api/daily`
3. That's it!

Everything else works exactly the same way. 🚀
